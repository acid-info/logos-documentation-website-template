# Create a DApp

This part is the same for both Poll and Vote SDK.

To demonstrate how to use the Waku Connect Poll/Vote SDK in your dApp, we will create a TypeScript React app from scratch.

You can then adapt the steps depending on your dApp configuration and build setup.

The Poll & Vote SDK features can only be used by token holders,
you must pass the ERC20 token contract of your choice when using the SDK.
Hence, you need to have an ERC-20 token contract address ready.
