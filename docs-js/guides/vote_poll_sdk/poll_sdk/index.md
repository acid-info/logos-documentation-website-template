# How to Use the Waku Connect Poll SDK

To demonstrate how to use the Waku Connect Poll SDK in your dApp, we will create a TypeScript React app from scratch.

You can then adapt the steps depending on your dApp configuration and build setup.

Only token holders can create & answer polls.
Hence, you need to have an ERC-20 token contract address ready.

The resulting code of this guide can be found at
https://github.com/status-im/wakuconnect-vote-poll-sdk/tree/main/examples/mainnet-poll.

Here is a preview of the end result:

After following a dapp creation guide you should have a dapp that can connect to wallet ready. We will continue from this point.

Before starting first add poll packages:

```shell
yarn add \
@waku/poll-sdk-react-components @waku/poll-sdk-react-hooks @waku/vote-poll-sdk-react-components
```
