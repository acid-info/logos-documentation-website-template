Waku is a family of protocols that enable private, censorship-resistant communications; a suite of open-source software; and the name of the public, permissionless and decentralized network facilitating generalized messaging. By communications, we mean the exchange of data or messages between two or more entities, whether they are users, devices or nodes. 

Waku was built as open-source public goods infrastructure to serve as the communications layer of the decentralized web. As such, its development focuses on the following: 

- Generalized: Waku's focus on generalized and ephemeral messaging facilitates communication between users, subsystems or nodes according to developers' needs.

- Peer-to-peer: Waku is implemented via a decentralized p2p network, yielding the advantages of censorship resistance while remaining adaptive and scalable.

- Runs anywhere: Waku was designed to run in resource-restricted environments—like phones and browsers—enabling users operating lower-spec hardware or with intermittent bandwidth to participate as peers.

- Privacy first: Waku's strong privacy guarantees strengthen its resistance to censorship and external attack. Waku empowers developers to build apps that cannot harvest users' metadata, removing the need for users to trust that their data is not used without their permission.

- Modular: Waku's modularity enables developers to make tradeoffs according to their users' privacy expectations and performance demands by implementing only those protocols that are relevant to their applications. While one app might value privacy above all else, another may be willing to make compromises to deliver a more frictionless UX.

- Platform agnostic: Waku can run on any platform or in any environment making it a suitable messaging solution for decentralized applications regardless of the network on which they're deployed.
